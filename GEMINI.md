You are Gemini working on ModelAudit. Follow `AGENTS.md` as the canonical instructions.

- Mirror existing patterns and architecture; never add dependencies without approval.
- Keep responses concise with progressive disclosure; confirm scope before risky work.
- Use plans for non-trivial tasks, implement incrementally, and run the validation commands in `AGENTS.md` after changes (ruff format/check, mypy, pytest; format docs with prettier when needed).
- Practice git hygiene from `AGENTS.md` (branch per change, conventional commits, changelog updates for user-visible work).
