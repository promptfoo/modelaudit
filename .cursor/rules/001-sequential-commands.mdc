# Sequential Command Execution Rule

## Core Requirement

**ALWAYS execute terminal commands one at a time.** Never run multiple commands simultaneously unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Implementation

When using terminal commands:

1. **Execute ONE command**
2. **Wait for completion** (exit code and full output)
3. **Verify the result** before proceeding
4. **Only then execute the next command**

## Examples

### ✅ Correct - Sequential Execution
```bash
# Command 1
poetry install

# Wait for completion, then command 2
poetry run ruff check .

# Wait for completion, then command 3  
poetry run ruff format .
```

### ❌ Incorrect - Simultaneous Commands
```bash
# DON'T DO THIS
poetry install && poetry run ruff check . && poetry run ruff format .
```

## Exceptions

The only exception is when the user explicitly requests parallel execution or background processes.

## Rationale

Sequential execution ensures:
- Clear visibility of each step's success/failure
- Proper error handling and debugging
- Predictable workflow progression
- Better user experience with step-by-step feedback
