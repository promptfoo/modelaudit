# CLAUDE.md

Follow `AGENTS.md` as the canonical instructions for ModelAudit.

- Keep responses concise via progressive disclosure; surface only the context the user needs.
- Share a short plan for non-trivial work, iterate in small steps, and verify each change.
- Confirm scope before any risky or ambiguous action; prioritize security and existing conventions.
